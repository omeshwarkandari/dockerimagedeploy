HPA (Horzontal Pod Scaler)
HPA helps in horizontal auto-scaling of the pods whenever the reource utilization recahed the threshhold limit as defined in the deployment file for the application
e.g. petclinic/templates/deployment.yaml
resources:
          limits:
            cpu: '1'
            memory: '500Mi'
          requests:
            cpu: '1'
            memory: '500Mi'
The pre-requisite of HPA is Metric-server.
