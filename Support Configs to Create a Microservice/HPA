HPA (Horzontal Pod Scaler)
HPA helps in horizontal auto-scaling of the pods whenever the reource utilization recahed the threshhold limit as defined in the deployment file for the application
e.g. petclinic/templates/deployment.yaml, we have set that a container can utilize max 1 CPU and 500MB of memory and when the target utilization defined in the 
petclinic/templates/petclinic-hpa.yaml e.g. 50% then a new pod shoud be created automatically to keep the application runing to avoid the outage.
petclinic/templates/deployment.yaml:-
resources:
          limits:
            cpu: '1'
            memory: '500Mi'
          requests:
            cpu: '1'
            memory: '500Mi'
petclinic/templates/petclinic-hpa.yaml          
targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50

The pre-requisite of HPA is Metric-server.
